# Real Estate Business Analytics

### by Tendai Milicent Jonhasi

## Overview
This project delivers a comprehensive dashboard that analyzes the real estate market in Singapore. It focuses on property characteristics, market dynamics, sales data analytics, and geographical location insights. The objective is to equip stakeholders—such as investors, developers, and policymakers—with actionable, data-driven insights for informed decision-making in real estate investments.

## Project Objectives
1. **Visualize Market Dynamics**: Provide intuitive visualizations of real estate market trends, including supply-demand relationships, sales volumes, and price variations across regions.
2. **Support Informed Decisions**: Empower investors and developers with actionable insights to guide investments and strategy.
3. **Highlight Key Trends**: Examine factors like property age, lease duration, resale value, and geographic distribution of transactions.
4. **Offer Comprehensive Analysis**: Present an in-depth analysis of property characteristics, market transactions, and location-based insights.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes information about 141,668 HDB resale flats in Singapore. Key columns:
- `block`, `flat_model`, `flat_type`, `floor_area_sqm`, `lease_commence_date`, `month`, `remaining_lease`, `resale_price`, `story_range`, `street_name`, `town`, `street_lat`, `street_lon`, `town_lat`, `town_lon`.

## Key Features
1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Transformed and cleaned data for analysis, handling inconsistencies such as spelling errors and deriving meaningful columns like `year of lease commencement`.
   - Calculated key performance indicators (KPIs) using DAX and Power BI tools.
  
2. **Market Dynamics**:
   - Provided insights into property price trends, resale volumes, and supply-demand dynamics in different regions.

3. **Sales Data Analytics**:
   - Deep dive into sales trends and property performance with a focus on financial metrics like average resale prices, sales volumes, and YoY analysis.

4. **Property Characteristics**:
   - Analyzed flat types and sizes, showcasing trends in resale values based on property models and remaining lease durations.

5. **Geospatial Analysis**:
   - Mapped property transactions, highlighting market hotspots and premium neighborhoods, aiding in location-based decision-making.

## Key Visualizations
- **Heatmaps**: Show transaction density across regions such as Jurong West and Bukit Timah.
- **Price Trends**: Track fluctuations in resale prices for top flat models over time.
- **KPIs**: Average resale value, transaction volumes, and YoY changes.

## Recommendations
1. Focus investments on **high-demand areas** like Jurong West and Tampines for strong market activity.
2. Diversify into **premium models** (e.g., Multi-Generation flats) to maximize returns.
3. Leverage high price-per-sqm opportunities in low-density towns like Bukit Timah.
4. Align marketing strategies with **buyer preferences** in key locations based on data insights.
5. Explore long-term growth in **lower-density areas**, anticipating urban expansion.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI**: For dashboard development, data modeling, and visualizations.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Used for calculating key metrics such as YoY sales volume and average resale prices.
- **Power Query**: To clean and transform data.
- **Python**: For supplementary data processing and modeling.

## Installation & Usage
